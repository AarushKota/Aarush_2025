    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Aarush Kota and I am a Junior in Del Norte High School. I am 16 years old and have a family of 4. I enjoy playing soccer and I played soccer for 10 years and hope to make a team in Del Norte this year. I enjoy math and science a lot because solving problems and doing experiments is fun for me. I want to study astronomy and be a part of NASA or play soccer for college and a pro league. My skills are learning through observation and being able to learn things quickly. I was inspired to take this course due to the opportunities of understanding computers and the commands you can learn so if you or your family are having trouble, you could use the skills you learn to help others.
