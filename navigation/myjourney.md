When setting up the tools and equipment, I had trouble navigating the website becuase it was very disjunct and hard to understand. The setup page I needed to do were at the bottom of the tools page and I had to jump up to the top for things I needed to do. I was normally caught scolling dowm amd up and it confused me at times. I also had problems with internet connection which interfered with the installation process and sometimes my computer didn't recongnize my name because the file was not made. I resolved this after making a gitclone for the portfolio_2025 and the student_2025. All in all the challenges I experienced are now things I am confident I can solve independantly and look forward to learning more as the weeks go on.
