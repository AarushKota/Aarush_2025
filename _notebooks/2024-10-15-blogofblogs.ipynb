    "I taught lesson 3.2.7 and learned how sets are unique that store different elements and variables which are created by adding elements in the {}. You can also remove sets, combine sets, and pull specific elements from two sets with the same elements. I also taught lesson 3.2.8 which was about booleans. I learned that booleans are a type of data that can output a true statement or false statement. You can use booleans to control the flow of a program, comparing two or more values, conditional statements, and many more. "

When defining a variable, you cannot use spaces, but you can add an underscore and capital letters to act like a gap between letters if you desire or if you want to name the same variable in different ways.\n"
